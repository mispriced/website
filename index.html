      <p>I've most recently been the CTO of
      <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, a crypto trading platform, and
      GP of <a href="https://daa.ltd/"> DAA</a>, a digital asset fund.</p>
      <p>I spent most of my prior life in high frequency trading, predominantly
      markets around Asia.</p>

      <p>I'm currently based in Tokyo, hopefully never to leave.</p>

        </li>
        <li>More automated, less chat-focused building of software with AI</li>
        <li>
          Zero-knowledge proofs, particularly simple use cases, or their
          application in off-chain products
        </li>
      </ul></p>
